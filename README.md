"**The Windy City**," "**Second City**," "**City of Big Shoulders**" are some of the monikers describing Chicago.  It is the largest American city in the midwest and home to **2.7 million** people as of the **2020 census**. It has been my home for more than 20 years, and I love living in this city.  Chicago has a lot to offer, from theaters, bars, popular sports team, restaurants, outdoor activities, and many more. In addition, it is on the southwest corner of **Lake Michigan**, which makes living in this city more fun than many other cities in America, especially during summertime.

This project is an exploratory data analysis as part of the **Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree** through **Western Governors University**. I will be using the XML dataset for Chicago that I have extracted from OpenStreetMap https://www.openstreetmap.org/relation/122604. OpenStreetMap is a collaborative project attempting to create geographic map of the world. 

I am using **Jupyter Notebook** and writing the codes in **Python**. This project calls for this dataset to be audited, cleaned, convert to **CSV** and uploaded to a database(SQL).  Once uploaded in a database, I will write SQL statements to explore the dataset and discover some fun facts about Chicago.
